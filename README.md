# GamerMob

This is my final app for DevMountain.  It was built to allow gamers to organize online gaming sessions together.  It allows 
people to create sessions based on console, video game, date, time and write a brief description about their session.  This in
turn will be added to a list of gaming sessions that is made searchable.  Other players should be able to quickly search through
sessions according to the above parameters.  The main goal is making it easy to connect the gamers to each other in order to 
play through games that require teams of several people and have no matchmaking or games that require teammates that 
communicate.  

This app is using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap as the main CSS framework.  The main framework for the JavaScript is Angular.js Angular is using several modules including uiRouter, ngAnimate and uiBootstrap.  The backend is comprised of a node.js server
using the Express and Sequelize modules.  The database for my session data is PostgreSQL and I have messenger that is using
Firebase.
